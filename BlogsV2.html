<h2>What makes Video games so entertaining?</h2>
<p>
Videogames are a great way to escape from reality and do something fun with others or yourself (it’s up to you!). 
Bright colors, a good story, and gameplay, in general, can impact a person's idea of the game (and get them addicted…). I play video games every chance I get because I really love them!
<br>

<p>-Article;https://gamequitters.com/15-reasons-people-play-video-games/(summarizing)</p>
<p>-Videogames can be fun and are a great way to make friends. People compete in video games which makes it all more exciting. Exploring, doing quests, taking risks, and failing are 
reasons why most people play video games or just games in general.</p>

<h2>Reviewing A game Review (splatoon 3 Edition)</h2>
<p>-https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/splatoon-3 </p>
<p>Most people who have posted reviews are saying positive things about Splatoon 3. I agree on the parts that the story is great and easy to keep up with and the gameplay with its bright colors is amazing. 
The only thing I don’t like about splatoon is the online membership that is required to play. Paying 20$ a year is a total scam!</p>

 <h2>What Computer setup is right for me?</h2.
<p>-https://www.cgdirector.com/what-kind-of-computer-do-i-need/ </p>
<p>In the article, a computer is mostly used for the best graphics and high-speed connections while gaming is mostly that. I love gaming but I really want to learn how to code. 
A big tabletop computer isn’t needed to code. 
A laptop can do the same thing and hold games (But maybe not the best graphics). I’m mostly interested in the laptop so I can code on the go (When I do start to code).</p>

<h2>Video game questions</h2>
<p>-What makes a game good?</p>
A great story, gameplay, and visual effects all make up a good videogame
<p>-Sandbox is a type of great videogame genre. Minecraft is the most well-known sandbox game ever made.
 A sandbox game can’t really be a bad game but there are some people that don’t like sandbox games like the Amazing Spiderman 2, Raven's Cry, etc.</p>
<p>-If done poorly, visuals or graphics might lower a player's opinion of a sandbox game.</p>

<h2>Presentation reflection</h2>
<p>-I think that Alex and I really projected our voices and explained our presentation well. </p>
<p>-I honestly don’t think that I would’ve changed anything. I like it just the way it is. </p>
<p>-My favorite part was getting to do the research on it.</p>

<h2>What makes a good Esports team?</h2>
<p>-https://www.rookieroad.com/esports/top-10-esports-teams/#1-faze-clan </p>
<p>I personally don’t have a favorite Esports team so I’m going to use FaZe clan for this example.
Over the years, the FaZe clan has had a pretty successful career in gaming. They’ve gotten tons of sponsorships and won many competitions. 
They have all of this because of their teamwork in the competitions. However, their external behavior reflects badly on them. Yes, their career game wise has been successful but their actions, 
if continued, will cause them to lose sponsorships.

<h2>New Technology</h2>
<p>A new technological invention I'm looking forward to is Augmented reality because it looks so cool and the mixing of real life and a simulation is very fascinating.
The Article provided best explains what AR is but I'm going to summarize it for you. Augmented Reality is an enhanced, interactive version of the real world enviorment. AR 
incorporates three features: a combination of digital and physical aspects, interactions in real-time, and accurate 3D identification of virtual and real objects.
I personally believe that AR is the future that is going to help everybody, granted they want its help. AR can be used to train employees, as it already does but it can be used more often.
AR is already greatly used and think of the possibilities. If you've played or watched Five Nights at Freddy's Security breach RUIN DLC then you already know the things that can be accomplished with this
technology.</p>

<h1>Creative Commons</h1>
<p>Creative commons are pieces of stuff that can be used by the community to make other stuff, Some people call it inspiration. Some people may not want people to take their ideas like creative commons. So copyrighted became
  a thing so people's works were protected if they didn't want people to copy them. You can use a lot of different videos, images, and music 
in certain libraries, digital-wise. There are many sources that can be used for Creative Commons so I'm gonna list some examples below:</p>

<ul>
  <li> Wikipedia, Google, and MusicBrainz are examples of creative common search engines</li>
  <li>Free Culture, Free Souls, and The Future Ideas are some examples of Creative Commons books</li>
  <li>Flicker, Mapilary, and Mushroom Observer are examples of Creative Common Images</li>
</ul>


  The school's filtering system literally won't let me go to any of the sights that I wish to share so I'm Just gonna give you the links to go
  find it yourselves. Okay? Cool

  <h2>Health Technology</h2>

  <p> Throughout our generation, a variety of technologies has been developed to monitor and in some cases help people with their health,
    and an example I'm gonna use is the Fitbit. The Firbit can track stress levels and heart rate levels. This information can be used to tell us
  when we need to move around, eat healthy, etc. I would suggest this technology to gamers, especially because 
  gamers spend most of their time looking at a screen sitting down. This device will help tell gamers when they need to do the stuff needed 
  to have and maintain a healthy diet. the optical heart-rate sensor in your Fitbit device flashes its green LEDs many times per second and 
    uses light-sensitive photodiodes  to detect these volume changes in the capillary
    is above your wrist. Then your device calculates how many times your heart beats per minute. 
    Step counts could also serve in place of the 6-minute walk test – how far a patient can walk in 
    6  minutes – an indicator of overall health in chronically ill patients. It's pretty simple if you keep up and yes, it is easy to keep up.</p>

<h2>My favorite game on PC and console</h2>
  <p>There are all sorts of games that have been made that spark my interest but only a few can get my full attention. I could play Pokemon or Valorant but I'd rather be playing Splatoon
    or Fortnite on my Nintendo Switch or if that's not available, I would play Subway Surfers on my phone. You've heard me talk about this a lot and you already know it, my favorite game of all time is Splatoon!!!
  I really love Splatoon because it provides a challenge as well as other options of gameplay like a story mode and teamwork opportunities. I've reviewed a review, which is listed below, and I totally agree with the bright side
  of it! however, there are some aspects of the game that are way too similar to past games which is sad but true.</p>

  <h2>OBS response</h2>

  <p> I found playing the actual game to be the easiest part of this overall assignment. However, the recording as well as the putting together part was the most challenging.
  if I were to record, I would definitely use an overlay mostly because it has a format to it and keeps everything organized. I wouldn't have to start from scratch. I believe it is most beneficial to record first and then add commentary later because if you try to record 
  while playing, it will be very distracting causing you to mess up. This recording process definitely takes work and now I feel how YouTubers feel. Also, a script is best because you'll know what you want to say as well as when to say it. </p>
