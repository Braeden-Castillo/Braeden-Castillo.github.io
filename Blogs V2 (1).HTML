<h2>What makes Video games so entertaining?</h2>
<p>
Videogames are a great way to escape from reality and do something fun with others or yourself (it’s up to you!). 
Bright colors, a good story, and gameplay, in general, can impact a person's idea of the game (and get them addicted…). I play video games every chance I get because I really love them!

<p>-Article;https://gamequitters.com/15-reasons-people-play-video-games/(summarizing)</p>
<p>-Videogames can be fun and are a great way to make friends. People compete in video games which makes it all more exciting. Exploring, doing quests, taking risks, and failing are 
reasons why most people play video games or just games in general.</p>

<h2>Reviewing A game Review (splatoon 3 Edition)</h2>
<p.-https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/splatoon-3 </p>
<p>Most people that have posted reviews are saying positive things about Splatoon 3. I agree on the parts that the story is great and easy to keep up with and the gameplay with its bright colors is amazing. 
The only thing I don’t like about splatoon is the online membership that is required to play. Paying 20$ a year is a total scam!</p>

 <h2>What Computer setup is right for me?</h2.
<p>-https://www.cgdirector.com/what-kind-of-computer-do-i-need/ </p>
<p>In the article, a computer is mostly used for the best graphics and high speed connections which gaming is mostly that. I love gaming but I really want to learn how to code. 
A big table top computer isn’t needed to code. 
A laptop can do the same thing and hold games (But maybe not the best graphics). I’m mostly interested in the laptop so I can code on the go (When I do start to code).</p>

<h2>Video game questions</h2>
<p>-What makes a game good?</p>
A great story, gameplay, and visual effects all make up a good videogame
<p>-Sandbox is a type of great videogame genre. Minecraft is the most well-known sandbox game ever made.
 A sandbox game can’t really be a bad game but there are some people that don’t like sandbox games like the amazing Spiderman 2, Raven's Cry, etc.</p>
<p>-If done poorly, visuals or graphics might lower a player's opinion of a sandbox game.</p>

<h2>Presentation reflection</h2>
<p>-I think that Alex and I really projected our voices and explained our presentation well. </p>
<p>-I honestly don’t think that I would’ve changed anything. I like it just the way it is. </p>
<p>-My favorite part was getting to do the research on it.</p>

<h2>What makes a good Esports team?</h2>
<p>-https://www.rookieroad.com/esports/top-10-esports-teams/#1-faze-clan </p>
<p>I personally don’t have a favorite Esports team so i’m going to use FaZe clan for this example.
Over the years, FaZe clan has had a pretty successful career in gaming. They’ve gotten tons of sponsorships and won many competitions. 
They have all of this because of their teamwork in the competitions. However, their external behavior reflects badly on them. Yes, their career game wise has been successful but their actions, 
if continued, will cause them to lose sponsorships.

<h2>New Technology</h2>
<p>A new techynological invention i'm looking forward to is Augmented reality because it looks so cool and the mixing of real life and a simulation is very fascinating.
The Article provided best explains what AR is but I'm going to summarize it for you. Augmented Reality is an enhanced, interactive version of the real world enviorment. AR 
incorporates three features: a combination of digital and physical aspects, interactions in real time, and accurate 3D identification of virtual and real objects.
I personally believe that AR is the future that is going to help everybody, granted they want it's help. AR can be used to train employees, as it already does but it can be used more often.
AR is already grately used and think of the possibilities. If you've played or whatched Five Night's at Freddy's Security breach RUIN DLC then you already know the things that can be accomplished with this
technology.</p>
