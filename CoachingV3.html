      <p>My name is Braeden and I love Splatoon! Although I didn't play the first game, I played both the second and third games a lot! What's that?  You don't know what Splatoon is? Well, that's OK, I'll explain everything! (And no that isn't me but I like it) </p>
      <p>Splatoon is a third-person shooter that has multiple modes, the most popular mode being Turf War.  Instead of shooting bullets like in regular games, the weapons you use shoot ink!  Each mode consists of  2 teams of 4 players. I forgot to mention, that your character can be selected as an inkling or octoling. Why is this important? Because your character can turn into a squid or an octopus and swim through your color of ink!!!</p>

      <h4>Splatoon 3 Trailer</h4>
      <p class="tag">(The first one ever)</p>
      <p class="text_column"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUYDXVDLmns"> Trailer :D</a></p>

    <div class="thumbnail"> <a href="#"><img src="images/turfwar.jfif" width="275" height="183" alt=""/></a>
      <h4>Turf War</h4>
      <p class="tag">(The main mode)</p>
      <p class="text_column">In this mode, Both teams compete and try to cover as much of the map as they can in under 3 minutes. Yeah this one's pretty simple.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="thumbnail"> <a href="#"><img src="images/images.jfif" width="250" height="141" alt=""/></a>
      <h4>Clam Blitz</h4>
      
      <p class="text_column">There are clams scattered around the map and players must collect them. Once a player has enough (usually 8),  the clams will combine into a football. There is a hanging basket in the enemies base which can only be opened with a football. Once the shield is broken, regular clams can be thrown in. The game ends if a teams basket is filled to the max with clams or whoever basket has the most at the end of a 5 minute period. Clams will be dropped if you die though...</p>

    <div class="thumbnail"> <a href="#"><img src="images/rainmaker.jpg" width="258" height="141" alt=""/></a>
      <h4>Rainmaker</h4>
      <p class="tag">(My favorite)</p>
      <p class="text_column">This weapon is set in the middle of the stage and the players need to shoot at the barrier around it to get it! The players then need to bring the rainmaker to different pedal stones, the first is a checkpoint, then the final one to win!</p>

  <div class="gallery">
    <div class="thumbnail"> <a href="#"><img src="images/splatzones.jfif" width="277" height="182" alt=""/></a>
      <h4>Splat Zones</h4>
      <p class="tag">(Good for Snipers)</p>
      <p class="text_column">A zone in the middle of the stage is highlighted and players must cover the area with their color of ink to claim it. A team must keep the zone for 99 seconds in order to win. Time is added to your count if the enemy claims it while you have it.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="thumbnail"> <a href="#"><img src="images/tower control.jpg" width="268" height="185" alt=""/></a>
      <h4>Tower Control</h4>
      <p class="tag">(Most played)</p>
      <p class="text_column">Similar to rainmaker, a structure is set in the middle of the stage and the tower will move when a player is on it (direction goes to the enemy base). The tower will travel around the stage and will make different stops. First to the finish line wins! or the farthest the tower moves if you run out of time.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="thumbnail"> <a href="#"><img src="images/salmon run.jpg" width="280" height="180" alt=""/></a>
      <h4>Salmon Run</h4>
      <p class="tag">(The only mode where you're not fighting players)</p>
      <p class="text_column">Salmon run is very different from the other modes. You'll be put on a map and fish-like creatures will come from the ocean and try to kill you. A few of these creatures are bosses and once defeated, they'll drop eggs which you then will deliver to a basket. You need to make a quota so be fast!.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="thumbnail"> <a href="#"><img src="images/teamwork.jpg" width="280" height="180" alt=""/></a>
      <h4>Important</h4>
      <p class="tag">(it is)</p>
      <p class="text_column">I've been a lot of games where some went well and others didn't. This game isn't a one man show so teamwork is required in every aspect of these modes. If you and your teammates don't communicate or don't help one another, the match is going to end up with a bad result.</p>
